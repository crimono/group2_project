Description: This package allows the user to get an idea of the happiness level 
    of Americans through the content of the tweets that were posted the same day.
    Batches of 1000 tweets are downloaded for each state of the US, with the 
    exception of Hawaii which doesn't have enough tweets available for a proper 
    sentiment analysis.Through the sentimentr package, the tweets are analysed and a 
    'happiness' score is given to each tweet, with extra weight given to tweets 
    based on the number of favorites of the tweet.
